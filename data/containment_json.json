Although Nepal had the laboratories and the skilled manpower to test for the disease, Nepal did not have the reagents required. The reagents cost around Rs 17,000 per test and need to be bought in bulk, sufficient for about 200 tests. As there were no other suspected cases needing testing, the officials decided to send the samples to Hong Kong instead of buying the reagents. The samples were sent to Hong Kong on 21 January. On 24 January, the Health ministry confirmed that the test had come back positive. The ministry said the patient was under surveillance, those who came into close contact with him were being investigated, and health information on all passengers returning from China was being sought. However, The Kathmandu Post quoted officials at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Disease as saying that no one knew of the patient's activity since he was discharged and that they were looking for him. Later, they said that they had only spoken to the patient on phone; he had reported being in good health and was not asked to come in for check-up or monitoring. The patient was confirmed completely treated when RT-PCR throat swabs returned negative for COVID-19 in followup assessments of 29 and 31 January. None of the people known to have come in contact with the patient showed any symptoms after three weeks of the patient's return to Nepal, and it was therefore presumed that he had not transmitted the disease to anyone else in Nepal.","Implementing City":null,"Implementing State\/Province":null,"Keywords":"case reporting, first case","Quantity":null,"Source":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_Nepal"},{"Country":"Palestine","Date Start":"Mar 05, 2020","Date end intended":null,"Description of measure implemented":"First case confirmed in the West Bank.","Implementing City":null,"Implementing State\/Province":null,"Keywords":"first case","Quantity":null,"Source":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_the_State_of_Palestine"},{"Country":"Afghanistan","Date Start":"Feb 24, 2020","Date end intended":null,"Description of measure implemented":"On 24 February, Afghanistan confirmed the first COVID-19 case.","Implementing City":null,"Implementing State\/Province":null,"Keywords":"first case","Quantity":null,"Source":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_Afghanistan"},{"Country":"Afghanistan","Date Start":"Mar 14, 2020","Date end intended":null,"Description of measure implemented":"President of Afghanistan, Ashraf Ghani, told the public to avoid large public gatherings and to pay attention to hygiene to prevent the spread of the disease.","Implementing City":null,"Implementing State\/Province":null,"Keywords":"public announcement","Quantity":null,"Source":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_Afghanistan"},{"Country":"Afghanistan","Date Start":"Mar 18, 2020","Date end intended":null,"Description of measure implemented":"On 18 March, the Ministry of Interior Affairs banned all large gatherings, including the closure of venues that attract large crowds such as entertainment places, sports grounds, swimming pools, fitness clubs and wedding halls.","Implementing City":null,"Implementing State\/Province":null,"Keywords":"social distancing, sports cancellation, weddings canceled","Quantity":null,"Source":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_Afghanistan"},{"Country":"Nepal","Date Start":"Feb 06, 2020","Date end intended":null,"Description of measure implemented":"By the first week of February, Nepal reported a shortage of face masks, as people hurried to buy them following reports of the first confirmed case.
